- Each course has multiple subject which are organised in sequence
- Each subject has multiple modules which are organised in sequence
- Each module has multiple units which are organised in sequence
- Each unit has multiple topics which are organised in sequence
- Each topic has multiple sub-topics which are organised in sequence
